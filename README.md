## Project Description: ##
Narrative game incorporating virtual objects telling the story of Walter Granger's 1900 Notebook. 

Players start with a transcription app that can be used on their phone, and also accessed at a kiosk in the museum.  Once players correctly transcribe journals, their accuracy will produce an allotted game time in a virtual paleontological dig.  The virtual reality simulation will be located at a kiosk situated within the museum.
